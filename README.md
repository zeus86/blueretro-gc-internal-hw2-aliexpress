# "iBlueControlMod" (BlueRetro) GC-internal-hw2 from aliexpress

These are some photos from the so called "iBlueControlMod" adapter for the gamecube from aliexpress. It clearly is based on [BlueRetro](https://github.com/darthcloud/BlueRetro/) , even tough they claim it isn't, and flashing BR onto it, will damage the controller. 

## ./img 
some images from the controller with as much components removed as feasible

## ./doc
content of the usb-stick, that came with the adapter (minus installation videos and the windows-app, because they are >100MB). However, I've included a [filelist](doc/filelist) with sha256sums for reference

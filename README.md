# "iBlueControlMod" (BlueRetro) GC-internal-hw2 from [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008130369868.html)

These are some photos from the so called "iBlueControlMod" adapter for the gamecube from aliexpress. It clearly is based on [BlueRetro](https://github.com/darthcloud/BlueRetro/) , even tough they claim it isn't, and flashing BR onto it, will damage the controller.  
**This repository uses 'git-lfs`** !

## ./img 
some images from the controller with as much components removed as feasible

## ./doc
content of the usb-stick, that came with the adapter (minus installation videos and the windows-app, because they are >100MB). However, I've included a [filelist](doc/filelist) with sha256sums for reference

the original pdf-manual-file is unfortunately ~187MB in size. a [scaled down version](doc/NGC_iBlueControlMod_Manual.pdf) is provided instead.

sha256sum: c9dbf2783e6adb7fca1d25daa21073453ba157ae2ce6b2ac6854793e7a6af279  NGC iBlueControlMod Manual.pdf
